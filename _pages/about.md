I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), supervised by [Alina Oprea](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/alina/). I obtained my PhD from [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I was extremely luck to be advised by Professor [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). My primary area of research is privacy/security in machine learning at a broad level, with fine-grained topics exploring membership inference, user inference, LLMs.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
