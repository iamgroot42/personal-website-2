I recently joined as a Member of Technical Staff at [DatologyAI](https://www.datologyai.com/)! Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), supervised by [Alina Oprea](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/alina/). I obtained my PhD from [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/).


During my time in academia, I studied the privacy and security challenges of machine learning models, both as targets of attacks and as amplifiers of risk; exploring how models can be exploited and how they transform the security landscape of systems that use them.
